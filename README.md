README: Leadership Alignment Dashboard Project
Project Overview
During my placement with Stature Leadership, I designed and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to support leadership alignment analysis. The dashboard translates qualitative survey data into clear, visual insights that enable the organization to assess leadership effectiveness across different teams and leadership levels.

Objective
The goal was to create a user-friendly, interactive reporting tool that helps stakeholders identify alignment gaps, track progress over time, and make informed decisions to improve leadership practices.

Data Sources
The primary dataset is a detailed Excel file containing leadership survey responses, including both qualitative and numeric data.

Survey data covers multiple leadership attributes, levels, and departments, allowing for granular analysis.

Key Features
Aggregation of qualitative responses into quantifiable metrics

Interactive filters by leadership level, department, and time period

Visualizations including cards, bar charts, and matrices to highlight trends and areas needing attention

Dynamic summary views to facilitate easy interpretation of complex data

Tools and Technologies
Microsoft Power BI for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation

Excel for initial data preparation and cleaning

DAX for calculated columns and measures to convert survey responses into meaningful KPIs

Impact
The dashboard delivered actionable insights that helped Stature Leadership’s team and clients better understand leadership alignment. Feedback from supervisors emphasized the dashboard’s clarity, professional design, and its role in supporting strategic leadership initiatives.

How to Use
